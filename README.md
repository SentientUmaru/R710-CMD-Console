# R710-CMD-Console
My Working console i use to connect to iDrac6 for Windows

Usage is straight forward.

Download as Zip and extract to a folder, and Run the bat file.
You'll get a prompt asking for ur domain or IP. 
After that you'll get asked for User and Pass, if everything is entered correctly it should open the virtual console.

This repo includes the java files and everything else needed, it should be as easy as just running the bat file.
